        <p>Starting meditation is not hard. You can simply find a comfortable spot to sit, listen to guides, and relax your mind. Even simpler, you can just focus on your breath without thinking anything else for five minutes. Or, you can taste food by focusing on its smell, texture, and juiciness. There is no much prerequisites for meditation. All it requires is your attention and focus. </p>
